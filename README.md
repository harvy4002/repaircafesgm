# Repair Cafes in Greater Manchester 

We have various repair cafes in Greater Manchester. Most run on saturday mornings.

## What is a repair cafe
A Repair Café is a friendly community space where people come together to fix broken items instead of throwing them away. Whether it’s a small appliance, a piece of clothing, or a gadget, our volunteer repair experts can help you bring it back to life. Enjoy a cup of coffee, learn new skills, and help reduce waste—all for free!
